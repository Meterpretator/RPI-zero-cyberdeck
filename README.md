## Why?
I was wonder to build some portable custom PC, which must fit the following requirements:
+ Cheap
+ Easy and fast to print and assemble: with minor soldering and CADing 
+ Modular: In theory, like plug-n-play. Just plug a whatever dongle (WIFI card, TTL-USB adapter, i.e.)
+ Either portable and handy
+ Easy to recustom

## Inspiration
Generally, this build is mixed from other's:
+ The design
    + https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/comments/xz8ngi/my_latest_build/
    + and https://github.com/surlydirtbag/nightcrawler

As I used RPI zero, the printable parts was modified in TinkerCAD. Original case for rpi zero with screen was found on Thingiverse
and merged with go pro mounts from [nigthcrawler cyberdeck](https://github.com/surlydirtbag/nightcrawler).
The powerbank frames also was modified to xiaomi PB fits in.
## Parts
+ Raspberry pi ZERO W
+ TFT screen: 3.5 inch RPI display with touch (or not)
+ RC keyboard: Rii mini X1
+ Powerbank: xiaomi PLM02ZM 10000mah
+ 1 OTG cable, 1 short usb cable

## Frames, case printing
All parts was printed using PLA on Ender 3 v2.
